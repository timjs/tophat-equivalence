\subsubject{Future work}

In future work, we would like to implement the transformation laws presented in \see[sec:laws] in \TOPHAT's symbolic execution engine \cite[conf/ifl/NausSK19].
This could speed up symbolic evaluation and give faster results on next step hints for end users.
Also, we would like to investigate the implications of our findings on the \ITASKS\ system,
which could benefit from implementing the transformation laws in the same way.

Regrettably, our previous choice in \cite[conf/ppdp/SteenvoordenNK19] to make pairing tasks ($t_1 \Pair t_2$) fail when both $t_1$ \emph{and} $t_2$ fail,
implies that the $\Task$ type constructor does not form an applicative functor.
This would be the case when we'd define $\Failing(t_1 \Pair t_2) = \Failing(t_1) \lor \Failing(t_2)$.
More research is needed to gain information on the impact of this change on the rest of the formalisation.
